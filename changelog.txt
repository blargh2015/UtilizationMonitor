Version: 0.9.3
Date: 2025.01.12
  Bugfixes:
    - Pumps to and from railcars have improved (although not perfect) tracking.
    - Use the new get_pumping_speed API call to better (although not perfect) handle quality pumps. Still need the get_flow() function replacement to perfect this and fix heat exchangers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.2
Date: 2024.12.15
  Bugfixes:
    - Changes made to space platforms are now tracked correctly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.1
Date: 2024.10.24
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix boilers without fuel showing 100% usage.
    - Fix pumps at 100% usage into empty pipes sometimes showing less than 100%.
  Info:
    - Heat exchangers are still disabled, and pumps are showing incorrect values when they are constrained by pipes. Both of these are due to the removal of get_flow(). See https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=116418. Let me know in this's mod's Discussion tab if you have ideas for workaround for this. Will keep working on it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2024.10.12
  Features:
    - Update for Factorio Space Age. Heat exchangers have lost support for the moment due to the removal of a key API function (get_flow) and no alternative for heat exchangers immediately obvious. Hopefully will fix soon.
