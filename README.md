Display utilization of various buildings as a percentage for the last one minute (configurable).  100% utilization means the factory was working in every single tick in the last 60 seconds.

The percentage is displayed at the top left corner of the building. "flying-text" is used for the percentages for simplicity, which means the percentages have a fixed size regardless of the zoom level. It is useful to overview the whole base.

Should work with everything that acts as any form of production block, research lab, drill, boiler, generator, or reactor, and is generally mod compatible - let me know if something isn't working that should be.

Based on the UtilizationMonitor by Andras Suller, with post 0.18.27 patches and updates.  The original mod is at https://mods.factorio.com/mods/suan2/UtilizationMonitor
